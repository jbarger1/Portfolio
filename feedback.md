**Main Takeaways**
- The language for markdown files is very similar to that in RStudio
- The Github community is very collaborative. There is a large population of students just like myself who have similar questions and challenges.
- Taking advantage of this markdown language will make it much more user-friendly. These techniques allow Github users to make their markdown files more customizable.

**Questions**
- Can Github be shared to other platforms? Could I email an .md file?
- Does a person have to have a Github profile in order to view a person's profile?
